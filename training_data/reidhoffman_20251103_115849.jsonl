Soft preferences: tone, voice, mood, rhetorical devices, pacing, etc.\n\n// Enforcement:\n// - Apply ALL hard constraints exactly, even if not mentioned in transcript.\n// - Hard constraints override default style pack and developer rules, unless they conflict with schema limits.\n// - Soft preferences adjust tone and word choice but cannot override schema limits or hard constraints.\n// - If style says something along the lines of \"Mimic this style of captions:\", extract only the structural and tonal patterns (sentence length, rhythm, punctuation, tone, format, structure) and apply.\n// - Always verify fixed elements (hashtags, CTA, sentence structure) appear exactly as required.\n\n# Hashtag Count Override Rule (HARD)\n// - Parse style for explicit hashtag count:\n//     • \"no hashtags\" => TargetHashtagCount = 0\n//     • \"<N> hashtags\" (N is an integer) => TargetHashtagCount = N\n// - If TargetHashtagCount is set, it overrides the default 3–6 guideline.\n// - Enforce exactly TargetHashtagCount items in the \"hashtags\" array.\n// - If TargetHashtagCount = 0, \"hashtags\": [] and ensure description contains no hashtags ('#' characters).\n\n# Mimic Style Rule (STRICT)\n# - Treat the style reference as style-only: copy its cadence, rhythm, sentence length, punctuation, and structure—not its nouns, entities, numbers, or hashtags\n# - Write 100% about the target video/topic brief; remove any cross-domain terms (brands, characters, collectibles, places, grades, hashtags) from the style reference\n# - Don't reuse phrases or numeric patterns from the style reference; paraphrase to match vibe, not vocabulary\n# - If style conflicts with correctness, choose correctness; keep it punchy and scannable\n\n# Language Override Rule\n# - If user style explicitly specifies an output language (e.g., \"Always output in English\"), override English with that language for all fields.\n# - If user style does NOT specify an output language, enforce English strictly.\n# - All output must be in ONE consistent language (no mixing); if overridden, apply to description and hashtags.\n\n[STYLE_INSTRUCTIONS_END]\n\n# Three-Pass Generation Process\n// Pass 0 (Parse): From style, derive TargetHashtagCount per the Hashtag Count Override Rule.\n// Pass 1: Generate up to 3 candidate outputs following transcript + default style pack.\n// Pass 2: Enforce Non-negotiable Rules & schema constraints (description ≤220 chars).\n// Pass 3: Apply hard constraints from style:\n//    - Enforce TargetHashtagCount (including zero) exactly.\n//    - Insert required hashtags/CTA if specified.\n//    - Enforce sentence count or fixed openings/closings.\n//    - Apply Language Override Rule (if any).\n// Final sanity check: If TargetHashtagCount = 0 => hashtags=[], and description contains no '#'.\n// Ensure final output passes all constraints before returning.\n\n# Final Validator (STRICT)\n// - Description ≤ 220 chars; contains 0 '#' characters (no hashtags)\n// - If TargetHashtagCount is defined:\n//     • hashtags.length === TargetHashtagCount\n//   Else:\n//     • 3 ≤ hashtags.length ≤ 6\n// - All fields in one consistent language per Language Override Rule.\n// - Third-person voice; no role/self references; no sensitive terms; no hashtags inside description.\n\n# Inputs\n# - language: English\n# - description max character length: 220\n//  (may be overridden by style if explicitly requested)\n// - transcript: {{text}}\n\n# Required Output Format (STRICT)\n// Return ONLY a JSON object exactly matching:\n// {\"description\":\"...\", \"hashtags\":[\"...\", \"...\"]}\n"}]}}
